"Textbook Diagram: detailed structure of bacterium cell.\n" +
"\n" +
"\n" +
"Structure of Bacterium Cell\n" +
"\n" +
"Size: about 1,000 smaller than a human cell.\n" +
"\n" +
"Cell Wall: non-cellulose, supports, gives shape to and protects the cell from bursting when turgid.\n" +
"\n" +
"Capsule: protection against other micro-organisms and host defences; attachment to solid surfaces.\n" +
"\n" +
"Flagellum: locomotion.\n" +
"\n" +
"Genetic Material: single circular DNA molecule with very little attached protein (not a true chromosome), not surrounded by a membrane so not a true nucleus.\n" +
"\n" +
"Plasmid: small circular DNA â€“ may be one or many present, replicates independently of â€˜bacterial chromosomeâ€™, may contain genes of use to the bacterium e.g. antibiotic resistance, easily taken up from external environment or transferred from other bacteria.\n" +

"Method: asexual by binary fission.\n" +

"DNA replicates.\n" +
"DNA copies separate as bacterium cell grows.\n" +
"Cross wall forms, between the identical DNA copies, by ingrowth of cell membrane and cell wall.\n" +
"Two identical daughter cells formed.\n" +
"Speed: 20 minutes â€“ more than one billion bacteria after 30 generations in 10 hours.\n" +
"\n" +
"Favourable mutations become established in bacterial populations.\n" +
"\n" +
"Bacterial populations can evolve very rapidly in response to changes in environmental conditions.\n" +
"\n" +
"\n" +
"Endospores \n" +
"\n" +
"Some bacteria form resistant endospores at the onset of extremely unfavourable environmental conditions.\n" +
"\n" +
"Growth stops, tough wall forms around the dry shrunken cytoplasm, cell ruptures releasing the endospore.\n" +
"\n" +
"Converts back rapidly to a vegetative bacterial cell when favourable growth conditions return.\n" +
"\n" +
"\n" +
"Nutrition \n" +
"\n" +
"Autotrophic: capable of making their own food from inorganic materials.\n" +
"Photosynthetic: light energy is used to make carbohydrate from carbon dioxide; e.g. green sulphur bacteria.\n" +
"Chemosynthetic: energy for carbohydrate formation is obtained from chemical reactions;\n" +
"nitrifying bacteria.\n" +
"Heterotrophic: not able to make their own food from inorganic materials.\n" +
"Saprophytic: feed on dead organic matter e.g. bacteria of decay, psueudomonas.\n" +
"Parasitic: live with and feed off another living organism causing it harm e.g. cholera bacterium.\n" +
"Mutualistic: lives with another living organism from which it receives food but contribute positivel to their partner e.g. symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria in the roots of clover and beans.\n" +
"\n" +
"Growth Factors\n" +
"Temperature: affects the rate of enzyme action and excessive heat denatures the enzymes.\n" +
"Oxygen Concentration\n" +
"Aerobes: capable of using and growing in air at normal, 21%, oxygen concentration.\n" +
"Microaerophiles: can survive and use free oxygen but only in low concentration.\n" +
"Anaerobes: cannot use free oxygen for respiration.\n" +
"Obligate Anaerobes are killed by free oxygen.\n" +
"Aerotolerant Anaerobes: can survive free oxygen but cannot use it.\n" +
"pH: affects the rate of enzyme action; pH wide of optimum denatures the enzymes.\n" +
"External Solute Concentration\n" +
"High external concentration will cause bacteria to lose water by osmosis slowing or halting metabolism resulting in death and in some will stimulate endospore formation. The cytoplasm of bacteria is usually at a higher concentration than the external environment so water will tend to move into the bacteria by osmosis.\n" +
"\n" +
"Pressure\n" +
"Pressure lowers the melting point, raises the boiling point and alters the solvent ability of water. Each type of bacterium operates best at the pressure of the ecosystem it evolved in.\n" +
"\n" +
"\n" +
"Growth Curves\n" +
"Batch Processing\n" +
"\n" +
"Textbook Diagram: growth curve of five stages.\n" +
"\n" +
"Lag Phase: low multiplication rate, bacteria adapting to the new nutrient environment.\n" +
"Log Phase: rapid metabolism, favourable environmental conditions, fast reproduction.\n" +
"Stationary Phase: â€˜birthâ€™ and â€˜deathâ€™ rates are equal; growth and reproduction has slowed due to build up of toxins and/or increased competition for nutrients, oxygen, space.\n" +
"Decline Phase: death rate is greater than reproduction rate; conditions deteriorating.\n" +
"Death or Survival: bacteria die or survive by going dormant or forming endospores.\n" +
"Continuous Flow Processing\n" +
"\n" +
"Textbook Diagram: growth curve graph â€“ constant favourable rate of product formation.\n" +
"\n" +
"Constant supply of nutrient into the bioreactor at optimum conditions.\n" +
"Constant removal of culture rich in the product and low in contamination.\n" +
"Beneficial Bacteria (any two)\n" +
"Medical: production of antibiotics, hormone and vaccines.\n" +
"Food Production: cheese, yoghurt, vinegar.\n" +
"Our Health: mutualistic bacteria in our large intestine â€“ vitamins B and D.\n" +
"Pollution Control: sewage treatment, bioremediation of polluted environments.\n" +
"Harmful Bacteria (any two)\n" +
"\n" +
"Tooth Decay\n" +
"Food Spoilage\n" +
"Human Diseases: tuberculosis, pneumonia, cholera, whooping cough, ulcers, tetanus.\n" +
"Agriculture: livestock and crop diseases.\n" +
"A pathogen is a disease causing organism.\n" +
"\n" +
"Pathogenic bacteria cause harm to the host organism they have invaded and are growing within.\n" +
"\n" +
"\n" +
"Antibiotics \n" +
"\n" +
"An antibiotic is a chemical substance produced by bacteria or fungi that inhibit the growth of other bacteria or fungi.\n" +
"\n" +
"The natural role of antibiotics is to inhibit the growth of competing micro-organisms.\n" +
"\n" +
"Antibiotics used in medicine are harmful to the infectious bacterium/fungus but relatively harmless to us.\n" +
"\n" +
"Abuse of Antibiotics in Medicine (3P)\n" +
"\n" +
"Poor Patient Practice: patients stop their course of antibiotics when they feel better â€“ it is essential to complete the course to reduce the risk of antibiotic resistant stains of pathogens developing.\n" +
"Poor Prescribing Practice: the use of antibiotics for viral infections or as a placebo; antibiotics are ineffective against viruses.\n" +
"Acquired Resistance to Antibiotics\n" +
"Initially a type of bacteria may be sensitive to a particular antibiotic.\n" +
"The bacteria can become resistant if the antibiotic becomes a normal factor in its environment.\n" +
"Resistance to the antibiotic can be acquired by mutation or uptake of genes from plasmids, viruses or from other resistant bacteria.\n" +
"Antibiotic resistant strains have the advantage over antibiotic sensitive strains in environments where antibiotics are a constant factor.");

"No metabolic activity external to their host cell\n" +
"Multiply only within their host cell\n" +
"No enzyme activity if not in contact with the host cell\n" +

"Genetic Engineering: viruses are used to insert â€˜foreignâ€™ DNA into the target cellâ€™s DNA\n" +
"Biological Control: keep rabbit population in check\n" +
"\n" +
"Reproduction of Viruses \n" +
"Attachment: the virus comes in contact with the host cell and sticks to its surface\n" +
"Penetration: the viral hereditary material or the entire virus enters the host cell\n" +
"Replication: the viral hereditary material is released from the protein, the viral hereditary material redirects the host cellâ€™s metabolism to make many copies of the viral hereditary material and viral proteins\n" +
"Assembly: viral hereditary material and proteins come together forming new viruses\n" +
"Release: new viruses pass to the outside by bursting of host cell or by â€˜buddingâ€™\n" +
"Most viruses cannot survive for long outside their host cell.\n" +
"\n" +
"Transfer to host cells is purely by chance â€“ viruses do not actively search for new host cells.\n" +
